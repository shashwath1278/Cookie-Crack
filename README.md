**Advanced Cookie Monitor** is a Chrome extension that helps users monitor and manage cookies on websites. The extension allows you to differentiate between **essential cookies** (necessary for website functionality) and **tracking cookies** (used for tracking user behavior) and provides the ability to **delete tracking cookies** to enhance privacy.
